# Qubic-Quorum-Proposal-Ecosystem-Soapbox
# IN DRAFT - RESEARCH: DOES THIS HARM THE ECOSYSTEM?
# PROPOSAL NOT LIVE

**Written by:** Misfitcompany  

## Proposal Summary
The Qubic Ecosystem Soapbox is a lightweight, community-driven platform and workflow for surfacing, vetting, debating, and prioritizing ecosystem issues without immediately drawing on Qubic Core developer resources. It pairs token‑validated community triage with moderated discussion and a clear escalation path to Core only when necessary. The goals are to reduce wasted developer time, increase transparency, improve user experience through timely community feedback, and provide an additional peer-review/security layer for projects building on Qubic.

## Problem
Current communication channels force participants to "dog whistle" developers and founders repeatedly to get attention on issues. Conversation is fragmented across channels and threads, problems are shuffled around, resolution is slow, and developer attention is used inefficiently. This impairs the network's integrity and the community's ability to self-organize around real problems.

## Solution
Create an "Ecosystem Soapbox" — a structured path and dedicated space for community-raised issues that includes:

- Public issue submission and tokenized community validation
- A moderated discussion or formal debate phase
- Consensus-driven proposal development
- Escalation to Qubic Core only when demonstrably necessary

The Soapbox acts as both a triage system and a transparent, auditable record of community concerns and decisions.

## How It Works (Workflow)
1. Issue Submission
   - Community members submit an issue via the Community Proposals Dapp.
   - Submissions must meet the Dapp's minimum token stake requirement ($[REDACTED]) to qualify for Soapbox consideration.

2. Community Validation
   - Tokenized voting on the Community Proposals Dapp determines whether the issue moves to the Soapbox discussion phase.
   - Only proposals that reach the required support threshold are opened for Soapbox discussion.

3. Soapbox Discussion
   - When validated, the original proposer opens the conversation in the Soapbox space.
   - Qubic Discord Moderators oversee conversations to ensure rules are followed and discussions remain constructive.
   - The discussion may be an open moderated thread or a structured formal debate depending on the issue severity.

4. Proposal Formation
   - Participants iterate on solution proposals in the Soapbox.
   - If a solution consensus is achieved, the original proposer will draft a consensus proposal that includes technical details, implementation steps, and risk mitigations to be presented to the community within the Soapbox discussion room, after peer review the proposal is put into a GitHub proposal and the project, team, or founder needing attention to the proposed issue is presented with the GitHub link in the official Qubic discord channel #general-chat

5. Escalation to Qubic Core
   - Core Developers are brought into the conversation only if:
     a) A community proposal clearly requires Core-level changes or resources to implement, or  
     b) Conversations devolve into unproductive personal attacks or cannot reach a resolution that benefits from Core adjudication.
   - Moderators control escalation to avoid unnecessary interruptions to Core workflows.

6. Resolution & Closure
   - Resolved issues and their final decisions/proposals are archived and linked to on-chain records where applicable.
   - No one single project, team, or founder is ever required to implement changes or address the issue(s) brought up through the Soapbox Discussion room.

## Implementation Roadmap
Phase 1 — Launch (0–4 weeks)
- Create Soapbox channel (or server) and publicize submission process.
- Define discussion rules, moderator roster, and escalation criteria.
- Integrate with Community Proposals Dapp for automatic validation flow.

Phase 2 — Operation (1–3 months)
- Run pilot: accept first cohort of validated proposals, iterate on moderation and debate format.
- Produce templates for consensus proposals and archiving.

Phase 3 — Formalize (3–6 months)
- Publish governance document capturing Soapbox rules, success metrics, and token mechanics.
- Automate cross-linking between Dapp, Soapbox archives, and relevant GitHub issues/PRs as needed.

## Roles & Responsibilities
- **Proposer:** Submits and, if validated, opens the Soapbox conversation.  
- **Community:** Validates issues via token voting and participates in discussion and proposal formation.  
- **Moderators:** Ensure civility, structure the debate when needed, and manage escalations.  
- **Core Developers:** Consulted or engaged only for implementation of core-level changes or to resolve serious disputes.

## Budget & Token Mechanics
- Assumed build cost: minimal to none; proposal expects low development effort leveraging existing Dapp and Discord tooling.
- Liquidity & token distribution:
  - 90% (900,000,000) of $[REDACTED] token supply to be evenly airdropped to all existing wallets on the network.
  - A community donation fund will be created by Qubic Core and, after 1 donation round, will be paired on QSWAP with the remaining 10% token supply to create initial liquidity and bootstrap post-airdrop token pricing.
- Liquidity, airdrop mechanics, and the donation fund will be documented in a separate token distribution plan prior to execution.

## Conclusion
Dog whistling wastes time and harms ecosystem integrity. The Qubic Ecosystem Soapbox offers a structured, token‑validated path for surfacing and resolving issues efficiently and transparently, reducing unnecessary demands on Core resources while empowering the community to self‑govern.

## Approval Options
0 — Do not approve  
1 — Approve creation of the "Soapbox Room" as a Discord channel  
2 — Approve creation of the "Soapbox Room" as a separate Discord server (for greater scale — brings with it complexity)
